      2. What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
      We’re going to program. Together. A Lot.

      3. What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills
      this semester?
      My goal is to make sure that I provide the optimal amount of teamwork to the
      group. Also to make sure that I’m available for my team to contact me.

      4. What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and
      personal goals?
      Communication might be too lax.

      5. What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B”
      will be acceptable?
      Always shoot for an A. You only shoot for a B if you don’t’ mind getting a C or
      lower.

      6. Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order
      to get an “A”?
      Work doesn’t need to be split in an exact 25%, but should be split well enough
      that everyone has to do at least 20% of the work. (even for an A).

      7. How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project
      successful?
      Two times a week as a group. As many as it takes to get it done for Individual.

      8. How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
      We have worked together before, so we know the strengths of each other and
      can assign accordingly.

      9. What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing
      deadline, no show, etc.)?
      The other three will have to pick up their slack and we’ll deal with the
      consequences.

      10.What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
      Then we’ll have a discussion as a team should.

      11.How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
      As a team we will all work the same way (discussions and opinions) then as a
      team they can work how they want.

      12.Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
      Preferably.

      13.How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
      Two times a week.

      14.Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
      No, one to one approval (Paired teams)

      15.What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
      Then we redo it to make sure it fits everyone’s agreement.

      16.What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
      If it works as a leadership role and everyone is fine with following, then it is ok.
      (As long as it isn’t work, just discussions)

      17.What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
      Then I will step up to the plate.
