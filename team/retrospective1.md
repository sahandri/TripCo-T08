# T08 Retrospective for Sprint 1

Area | What we did well | What we need to work on | What we will change
:--- | :------- | :--------- | :---------------------
**Teamwork** | Communication. We had a very active group chat and had meetings so we were all on the same page | Documentation of our code so our teammates can understand it without needing to ask a bunch of questions. | Sprint planning earlier in the iteration.
**Process** | Pull request process was utilized well. | We need to conduct more thorough testing (using Travis) before merging pull requests. | Use Travis to confirm pull requests (requires NO procrastination!)
**Tools** | master stayed clean throughout the iteration. issues were used effectively. | Our code needs more rigorous testing using JUnit. We all need to be able to run our project locally | Having a meeting to demo tests and the build process. Also, look at testing tools for React.
