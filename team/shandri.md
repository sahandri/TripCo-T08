 1. Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else? What hours?
  	I’d prefer texting and it can be any time.
 1. What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
    My expectation is working well as a team and help each other to finish our project in time and achieve full credit on that, also we       must be responsible for our duty.
 1. What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester? Since I don’t have that much experience in teamwork so I really like to improve my skills this semester, so I can learn from my team members to improve. My goal is working hard to learn teamwork and I’ll do my best to finish my tasks in time.   
 1. What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals? Scheduling a good time to meet up and work together will be not easy since we have different classes and different time schedules. Also, being in different skill levels can cause problems so we need to help each other to improve our skills.
 1. What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?	Since our project is a teamwork all the members must respect each other and help to be good in the project.
 1. Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”? 6.	It’s acceptable but I prefer to other team members help each other and respect each other so nobody gets annoyed.
 1. How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?	We should meet up at least once in a week to talk about the project and individual work depends on project and person, because some people are faster than others. I usually need more time to do assignments than others.
 1. How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?	Everybody has different skills so we can talk about them and decide who can do which part better.
 1. What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?	We should talk to them respectfully and try to help them, and if they have problem we might help them to overcome that problem.
 1. What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work? In my opinion that’s better, and that’s why teamwork is better that individual works. Everybody will look at the problem in different prospective and give an idea.
 1. How will you deal with different work habits of team members?	I’d try to tune myself with them as much as I can.
 1. Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?	Yes, because in class time we will get tired and we need more time to discuss about the project.
 1. How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?	I think once in a week so we can keep updated, but it can be more or less depending on the work we have.
 1. Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?	Yes, since I’m not working individually and the project is for the team, so their idea is very important to me.
 1. What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?	I’d respect that person and try to understand the reason of that, and explain my own idea so we can find a solution for that.
 1. What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?	I believe every team needs a leader and I’m not good in that, so having somebody which is good in that is good for the team.
 1. What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you? I’d try to talk to other team members and let them know about my feeling, so they can help me.
