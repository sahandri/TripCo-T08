  1. Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else? What hours?
    Texting is generally the easiest way to reach me anytime between 8am and 6pm. Email is
    the second best communication especially if larger amounts of information need to be
    shared. Anytime between 8am and 4pm.
  2. What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
    I expect that above all else we will learn how to effectively communicate and work
    simultaneously in order to do well on the projects throughout the course of the semester.
  3. What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills
  this semester?
     Personally, I want to make sure that I get in good habits of communicating early and
    often because I tend to wait until last minute when it comes to communication.
  4. What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and
  personal goals?
    Misinterpretation will probably be one of the bigger obstacles especially when using
    technology to communicate. There also may be personality differences within the team
    that affect our organization or ability to work cohesively.
  5. What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B”
  will be acceptable?
    I think it would be good to talk it out and come to an agreement but I believe that all
    group members should be putting in as much effort as they can.
  6. Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to
  get an “A”?
    I would think that all team members should be at least attempting to do the same amount
    of work.
  7. How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
    Since I am not yet aware of exactly what the assignment entails, I would assume that
    anywhere from 5-8 hours of work per person per week would make our group successful.
  8. How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
    Distributing the workload would be a good way to go about this so that everyone has a
    similar difficulty of tasks. This would ensure that no one is doing significantly more work
    than anyone else.
  9. What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing
  deadline, no show, etc.)?
    Have a constructive conversation about why they might have missed the deadline and
    how it impacts the group as well as how it could be avoided in the future.
  10. What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
    This is part of the reason that we are in a group. We are all not good at certain things so
    the group can help to raise each other’s standards as long as we are respectful.
  11. How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
    Unless it negatively affects the group, then work habits are not too important. We should
    all attempt to work on tasks as soon as possible. If work habits are causing issues then a
    group discussion about the impacts should happen.
  12. Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
    I think that having a meeting time of at least an hour of week would be a good thing for
    organizational purposes.
  13. How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
    At least once a week, but twice a week if possible.
  14. Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
    Yes I think this would help to avoid disputes over decisions that will be made.
  15. What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
    Talk it over and see why they disagree and what the alternative options would be.
  16. What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
    Talk to them about it. Sometimes it can be good to have someone take the lead but if they
    are trampling over ideas and opinions of the team then that is not good.
  17. What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
    Talk to the group and try to distribute them more evenly.
